# Fireworks Simulation using Python
Step by Step Python Tutorial on Fireworks Simulation Project
Fireworks Simulation achieved using Python Programming Language. I have used very little math & physics to keep the tutorial really really simple. This project is very useful not only for learning Class & Objects but also for the concept of graphics and sound effects in Python.

Every line of the code is throughly explained alongwith the use of sticky note for easy and quick grasping of the concepts.
